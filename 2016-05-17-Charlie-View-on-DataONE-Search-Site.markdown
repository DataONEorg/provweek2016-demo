Charlie discovers [Bob’s data packages](https://search-sandbox-2.test.dataone.org/#view/metadata_07277c1f-b2c2-467c-8aa2-792863524a21.xml) on DataONE and is able to navigate back to the
data that Bob used, i.e., [Alice’s data package](https://search-sandbox-2.test.dataone.org/#view/metadata_e859d2dd-c5e6-4ec6-892f-1b00bb6f8f65.xml). When he searches
the DataONE network using the same keyword **grass** from [DataONE Search Site](https://search-sandbox-2.test.dataone.org),
two data packages are displayed. One
data package is created by “Alice”, the other is created by “Bob”. Crucially,
the provenance of the two datasets is now manifested visually along with their logical
connection on DataONE and is available to Charlie. Specifically, Charlie can not only visualize the two data packages (Alice’s is at the top and Bob’s at the bottom), but he is also aware of the derivation of
Alice’s data through Bob’s script.
