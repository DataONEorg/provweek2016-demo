Charlie discovers Bob’s data packages on DataONE and is able to navigate back to the
data that Bob used, i.e., Alice’s data package depicted in Fig. 4 [9,11]. When he searches
the DataONE network using the same keyword “grass” from the web search interface,
two data packages are displayed as shown in Fig. 3, namely Alice’s and Bob’s. One
data package is created by “Alice” [17], the other is created by “Bob” [13]. Crucially,
the provenance of the two datasets is now manifested visually along with their logical
connection, as shown in the DataONE Search web UI for our demo site [2] (Fig. 4) and
is available to Charlie. Specifically, Charlie can not only visualize the two data packages
(Alice’s is at the top and Bob’s at the bottom), but he is also aware of the derivation of
Alice’s data through Bob’s script.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight matlab %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
