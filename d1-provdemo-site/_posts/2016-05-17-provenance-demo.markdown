Overview

The Matlab DataONE Toolbox collects information about Matlab script executions (aka runs). The captured information includes the files that were read and written by the Matlab script, and details of the execution environment, such as the operating system version, toolboxes loaded, etc.

The recorded information for a script constitutes data provenance for the data products and analysis outputs (graphs, .csv files, etc) generated by a script execution, by providing information to describe how the data products were created.

Check out the [Matlab-Dataone User Guide][matlab-dataone-user-guide] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Matlab-Dataone Github repo][matlab-dataone Github repo].
